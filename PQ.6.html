    <!--Poem-->
    <p>
        I met a traveller from an antique land,<br />
        Who said -"Two vasst and trunkless legs of stone<br />
        Stand in the deser. . . . Never them, on the sand,<br />
        Half sunk a shattered visage lies, whose frown,<br />
        And wrinkled lip, and sneer of cloud command,<br />
        Tell that its sculptor well thise passions read<br />
        Which yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things,<br />
        The hand that mocked them, and the heart that fed;<br />
        And on the pedestal, these words appear;<br />
        My name is Ozymandias. King of Kings;<br />
        Look on m Works, ye Mighty, and despair!<br />
        Nothing beside remains. Round the decay<br />
        of that colossal Wreck,boundless and bare<br />
        The lone and level sand stretch far away,"<br />
