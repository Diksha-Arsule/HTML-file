        I met a traveller from an antique land,
        Who said -"Two vasst and trunkless legs of stone
        Stand in the deser. . . . Never them, on the sand,
        Half sunk a shattered visage lies, whose frown,
        And wrinkled lip, and sneer of cloud command,
        Tell that its sculptor well thise passions read
        Which yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things

        The hand that mocked them, and the heart that fed;
        And on the pedestal, these words appear;
        My name is Ozymandias. King of Kings;
        Look on m Works, ye Mighty, and despair!
        Nothing beside remains. Round the decay
        of that colossal Wreck,boundless and bare
        The lone and level sand stretch far away,"
